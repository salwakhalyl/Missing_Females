Dataset: Missing Females in the US (1994-2021)
This dataset provides information on missing females in the United States between 1994 and 2021. The goal of this analysis is to determine which state has the highest number of missing females and to identify the race that is most affected by this issue.

Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset's accuracy and consistency, I performed data cleaning using SQL. This involved removing any duplicate entries, handling missing values, and standardizing the format of the data.

Data Analysis
Using the cleaned dataset, I conducted an analysis using Google Sheets to gain insights into the distribution of missing females across states and races.

Pivot Table: I created a pivot table to combine the race and state information of missing females. This allowed me to examine the intersection of these two variables and identify patterns.

Graphical Representation: To visualize the findings, I generated a graph based on the pivot table results. This graph provides a clear and concise representation of the states with the highest number of missing females and the racial groups that are most affected.

Results
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following conclusions were drawn:

State with the Highest Number of Missing Females: Michigan (MI). This state had the highest count of missing females between 1994 and 2021.

Race Most Affected by Missing Females: African American/Black and Caucasian / White. This 2 racial groups experienced the highest number of missing females during the specified period.
